    <article class="blog-post-content">
        <div class="blog-post-body">
            <p>From Limavady's ancient earth comes clay that speaks a universal language. Each piece bridges continents, carrying the warmth of Irish hospitality to tables around the world. This morning, the studio received a photograph from Tokyo – a McCluskey bowl cradling miso soup in a tiny apartment overlooking Mount Fuji. It's moments like these that remind us how far our local clay travels, and how many stories it gathers along the way.</p>

            <p>The clay used at McCluskey Pottery comes from the banks of the River Roe, just a short walk from the studio. It's the same clay source the family has used since the business began, passed down along with the knowledge of where to find the best deposits. Rich with iron oxide that gives it that distinctive warm colour when fired, this clay connects each generation to the last. But what makes this clay special isn't just its mineral content – it's the stories embedded in the very soil of Ireland.</p>

            <p>When the family digs clay in the early morning mist, following paths shown by the previous generation, one can't help but think about all who have worked this land. The Celts who first settled here, the monks who built their monasteries along the river, the farmers who have tended these fields for centuries. All of their stories are held in this earth, waiting to be shaped and shared by hands that learned their craft through family tradition.</p>

            <div class="pull-quote">
                "Every piece of pottery is an ambassador, carrying a fragment of Irish soul to distant shores, creating connections across oceans and cultures."
            </div>

            <p>Last year, the studio welcomed a visitor from California who had been given a McCluskey mug as a wedding gift twenty years ago. She told how that simple mug had become part of her morning ritual, how she thought of Ireland every time she drank her coffee. She had finally made the journey to Limavady to meet the hands that had shaped her daily companion. Sitting in the studio, sharing tea from freshly thrown cups, it became clear that this is what pottery is truly about – connection.</p>

            <p>McCluskey Pottery, now in the hands of the next generation, has been blessed to see work travel to over forty countries. Each piece carries not just the mark of skilled hands trained in the family tradition, but the essence of this place – the soft rain that falls on the Roe Valley, the green hills that roll toward the sea, the warmth of a turf fire on a winter evening. When someone in New York or Sydney or Mumbai uses one of these pieces, they're touching a part of Ireland and a continuing family legacy.</p>

            <p>The global reach of these simple vessels never ceases to amaze. The studio has received letters from a monastery in Japan where McCluskey bowls are used in tea ceremonies, photographs from a restaurant in Paris where the plates present Irish-inspired cuisine, stories from aid workers who've carried these cups to refugee camps, bringing a touch of beauty to difficult circumstances.</p>

            <p>But perhaps the most touching story comes from closer to home. A young couple from Belfast bought a set of McCluskey dinnerware for their first home together. Years later, their daughter wrote to say that those plates had been the backdrop to every important family meal – birthdays, graduations, Sunday dinners. Now she was ordering a set for her own new home, continuing the tradition.</p>

            <p>This is the magic of working with clay from Irish soil – it connects us all. Whether you're holding a McCluskey piece in Tokyo or Limavady, you're participating in an ancient tradition of gathering, sharing, and celebrating around handmade vessels. The clay remembers where it came from, and it carries that memory forward, creating new stories with each use.</p>

            <p>Currently, the studio is preparing pieces for an exhibition in Dublin, a commission for a restaurant in Boston, and a special order for a family reunion in Australia. Each piece will carry a bit of Limavady with it, a fragment of Irish soil transformed by fire into something both functional and beautiful. And each piece will gather new stories, becoming part of daily life in places far from home.</p>

            <p>This is the greatest joy at McCluskey Pottery – knowing that clay dug from Irish soil by the family for generations becomes part of global stories, connecting hearts and homes across the world through the simple act of sharing a meal, sipping tea, or gathering together. In every piece, Ireland travels outward, and the world comes home to Limavady, where the next generation continues the tradition begun so many years ago.</p>

        <h1>Welcome: The Living Art of Pottery</h1>
        
        <p class="section-intro">
            Your handmade pottery is more than a functional object ‚Äì it's a piece of living art that will evolve with your life, gathering stories and developing character with each use.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            When you bring home a piece of McCluskey pottery, you're welcoming something unique into your life. Unlike mass-produced ceramics, each handmade piece has its own personality, formed by the marriage of earth, water, fire, and human touch. This guide will help you understand and care for your pottery, ensuring it remains beautiful and functional for generations.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Understanding Your Handmade Pottery</h2>
        
        <p>
            Every piece of pottery from our studio is:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>High-fired stoneware</strong> - Fired to over 1280¬∞C, making it incredibly durable</li>
            <li><strong>Lead-free and food safe</strong> - All glazes are thoroughly tested</li>
            <li><strong>Unique</strong> - Slight variations in colour and form are part of its character</li>
            <li><strong>Designed for daily use</strong> - Not just for special occasions!</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Potter's Wisdom:</strong> The best way to honour your pottery is to use it. Daily use creates a patina of memory and adds to its beauty. Don't save it for "someday" ‚Äì today is special enough.
        </div>
        
        <h2>What Makes Handmade Different</h2>
        
        <p>
            Unlike factory ceramics, handmade pottery has soul. You might notice:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Slight irregularities in shape (the potter's hand is visible)</li>
            <li>Glaze variations (where the fire kissed it differently)</li>
            <li>Minor colour differences between pieces (the alchemy of the kiln)</li>
            <li>Throwing rings on the inside (evidence of the wheel)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            These aren't flaws ‚Äì they're signatures of authenticity, proof that human hands shaped this piece specifically for you.
        </p>

        <h1>First Days: Welcoming Your Pottery Home</h1>
        
        <p class="section-intro">
            The relationship between you and your pottery begins with how you welcome it into your life.
        </p>
        
        <h2>The First Wash</h2>
        
        <p>
            Before first use, gently wash your pottery with warm water and mild soap. This removes any pottery dust and begins your care relationship. Use this time to:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Feel the weight and balance in your hands</li>
            <li>Notice the glaze texture and colour variations</li>
            <li>Appreciate the base where you'll find the maker's mark</li>
            <li>Set your intention for how you'll use this piece</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Temperature Acclimatisation</h2>
        
        <p>
            If your pottery has traveled to reach you, especially in extreme weather, let it adjust to room temperature for a few hours before washing. Ceramic can be sensitive to sudden temperature changes, though our high-fired stoneware is remarkably resilient.
        </p>
        
        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Ancient Practice:</strong> Some potters recommend "seasoning" new pottery by rubbing the unglazed base with a cut lemon, then letting it dry. This traditional practice is said to strengthen the clay body.
        </div>
        
        <h2>Choosing Its Home</h2>
        
        <p>
            Where you store your pottery matters. Consider:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accessibility</strong> - Keep daily-use pieces within easy reach</li>
            <li><strong>Stability</strong> - Ensure shelves are level and strong</li>
            <li><strong>Visibility</strong> - Beautiful pottery deserves to be seen</li>
            <li><strong>Protection</strong> - Away from high-traffic areas where it might be knocked</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Chapter 3 -->
    <div class="page">
        <h1>Daily Care: The Essentials</h1>
        
        <p class="section-intro">
            Caring for your pottery is simple ‚Äì it's about consistency and gentleness rather than special treatments.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Washing Your Pottery</h2>
        
        <h3>Hand Washing (Recommended)</h3>
        <p>
            While our pottery is dishwasher safe, hand washing will keep it looking its best for longer:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Use warm (not hot) water</li>
            <li>Apply mild dish soap with a soft sponge or cloth</li>
            <li>Pay attention to textured areas where food might lodge</li>
            <li>Rinse thoroughly with warm water</li>
            <li>Dry immediately with a soft towel, or air dry on a rack</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Dishwasher Use</h3>
        <p>
            If using a dishwasher:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Place pieces securely so they won't knock against each other</li>
            <li>Use a gentle cycle with mild detergent</li>
            <li>Avoid overcrowding</li>
            <li>Skip the heated dry cycle if possible</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>Avoid:</strong> Harsh detergents, steel wool, scouring pads, or abrasive cleaners. These can damage the glaze and leave permanent marks.
        </div>
        
        <h2>Using Your Pottery</h2>

        <h1>Deep Cleaning: Removing Stubborn Stains</h1>
        
        <p class="section-intro">
            Even with regular care, your pottery may develop stains or marks. Here's how to restore its beauty naturally.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Tea and Coffee Stains</h2>
        
        <p>
            These common stains are easily removed with this gentle method:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Make a paste with baking soda and water (3:1 ratio)</li>
            <li>Apply to stained areas with a soft cloth</li>
            <li>Let sit for 15-20 minutes</li>
            <li>Gently rub in circular motions</li>
            <li>Rinse thoroughly with warm water</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Natural Alternative:</strong> A paste of salt and vinegar works wonderfully for tea stains and is completely food-safe.
        </div>
        
        <h2>Cutlery Marks</h2>
        
        <p>
            Those grey lines from cutlery are metal deposits on the glaze surface, not damage:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bar Keeper's Friend</strong> - A tiny amount on a damp cloth works miracles</li>
            <li><strong>Baking soda paste</strong> - Gentler option, requires more elbow grease</li>
            <li><strong>Cream of tartar paste</strong> - Mix with water, excellent for delicate glazes</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Food Stains and Odours</h2>
        
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Stain Type</th>
                <th>Treatment</th>

            <tr>
                <td>Tomato-based</td>

                <td>Hydrogen peroxide + sunlight</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <h3>For Persistent Odours</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Fill pottery with warm water</li>
            <li>Add 2 tablespoons baking soda</li>
            <li>Let soak overnight</li>

            Fine lines in the glaze that look like a spider web pattern:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What it is:</strong> Glaze contracting more than clay body</li>
            <li><strong>Is it a problem?</strong> Usually cosmetic only</li>
            <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Avoid extreme temperature changes</li>
            <li><strong>Living with it:</strong> Many collectors prize crazed pieces for their character</li>

        <h2>Chips and Nicks</h2>
        
        <div class="warning-box">
            <strong>Important:</strong> Small chips on food surfaces should be smoothed with fine sandpaper to prevent bacterial growth. If extensively chipped, retire the piece from food use.
        </div>
        
        <p>Options for chipped pieces:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Continue using if chip is small and smooth</li>
            <li>Repurpose as a planter or decorative piece</li>
            <li>Practice kintsugi (Japanese gold repair) for special pieces</li>

        <h1>The Science Behind the Care</h1>
        
        <p class="section-intro">
            Understanding the 'why' behind care instructions helps you make informed decisions about your pottery.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Clay Memory</h2>
        
        <p>
            Pottery retains a "memory" of its making:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Throwing direction:</strong> The spiral from wheel-throwing affects how pieces dry</li>
            <li><strong>Compression points:</strong> Areas pressed during shaping are strongest</li>
            <li><strong>Glaze thickness:</strong> Variations affect heat distribution</li>
            <li><strong>Firing temperature:</strong> Determines porosity and strength</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Why Temperature Matters</h2>
        
        <p>
            Pottery expands and contracts with temperature changes. The glaze and clay body expand at slightly different rates, which is why:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Gradual temperature changes are safer than sudden ones</li>
            <li>Preheating plates prevents thermal shock</li>
            <li>Room temperature storage is ideal</li>
            <li>Consistent dishwasher placement reduces stress</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Physics Fact:</strong> A mug can withstand the thermal shock of hot tea because the liquid pours in gradually, allowing the ceramic to adjust. The same mug might crack if plunged into boiling water.

        <h1>Seasonal Care Considerations</h1>
        
        <p class="section-intro">
            Each season brings unique considerations for pottery care, especially in Ireland's varied climate.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Spring</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Deep clean</strong> stored pieces before use</li>
            <li><strong>Check</strong> for winter storage damage</li>
            <li><strong>Transition</strong> gradually from storage to use</li>
            <li><strong>Perfect time</strong> to reorganise your collection</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Summer</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Outdoor use:</strong> Bring pottery in during storms</li>
            <li><strong>Sun exposure:</strong> Rotate displayed pieces to prevent uneven fading</li>
            <li><strong>Picnics:</strong> Transport carefully in baskets with padding</li>
            <li><strong>Garden parties:</strong> Designate outdoor-only pieces</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Autumn</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Temperature swings:</strong> Be extra careful with thermal shock</li>
            <li><strong>Harvest season:</strong> Acidic preserves can stain; seal jars properly</li>
            <li><strong>Prep for holidays:</strong> Check and clean special occasion pieces</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Winter</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Heating:</strong> Keep pottery away from radiators and fires</li>
            <li><strong>Cold surfaces:</strong> Use trivets on cold counters</li>
            <li><strong>Holiday use:</strong> Warm serving dishes gradually</li>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Ensure cupboards aren't too cold</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="quote">
            "In Ireland, we say pottery is like people ‚Äì it prefers the middle path. Not too hot, not too cold, not too wet, not too dry."

    <div class="page">
        <h1>When Pottery Tells Its Story</h1>
        
        <p class="section-intro">
            Over time, your pottery develops a patina ‚Äì visual evidence of a life well-lived. Learning to read and appreciate these changes deepens your connection to each piece.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Reading the Signs</h2>
        
        <h3>Glaze Evolution</h3>
        <p>
            Some glazes change subtly over time:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Matte glazes</strong> may develop a subtle sheen from handling</li>
            <li><strong>Crystalline glazes</strong> can shift in certain lights</li>
            <li><strong>Wood ash glazes</strong> deepen and enrich with use</li>
            <li><strong>Copper glazes</strong> may develop new colour notes</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Use Patterns</h3>
        <p>
            Your pottery will show where it's been loved:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Spoon rests in bowls</li>
            <li>Favourite mug handle wearing smooth</li>
            <li>Plate centres showing gentle wear</li>
            <li>Pour spots on pitcher spouts</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Embrace the Journey:</strong> In Japan, the concept of 'wabi-sabi' celebrates imperfection and impermanence. Your pottery's changes are part of its beauty, not flaws to hide.
        </div>
        
        <h2>Memory Marks</h2>
        
        <p>
            Some marks tell stories worth preserving:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The chip from your daughter's first attempt at washing up</li>
            <li>The tea stain from countless morning conversations</li>
            <li>The worn spot where your thumb naturally rests</li>
            <li>The glaze crackle that appeared during a memorable dinner party</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
            These aren't damage ‚Äì they're autobiography written in clay.

            As you close this guide, remember that the best care comes from love and use, not perfection.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Your pottery was made to be part of your life. It was born in fire and will survive much more than you might think. Yes, care for it well - but don't let fear of damage prevent you from using and enjoying it fully.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Each piece in your collection has traveled from earth to wheel to kiln to reach your hands. It carries the story of its making, and now it will carry the story of your life too. The meal shared with friends, the quiet morning tea, the birthday cake served, the flowers displayed - these moments are what pottery lives for.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Remember</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Handmade pottery is stronger than it looks</li>
            <li>Character marks are evidence of a life well-lived</li>
            <li>The best care is regular, gentle attention</li>
            <li>When in doubt, choose the gentler option</li>
            <li>Your pottery wants to be used, not hidden away</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>Final Thought:</strong> In a world of disposable goods, caring for handmade pottery is a radical act. It's choosing permanence over convenience, beauty over perfection, and connection over isolation.

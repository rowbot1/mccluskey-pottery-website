            Scattered across the Irish countryside, thatched cottages stand as monuments to simpler times, 
            their whitewashed walls and colorful doors holding centuries of stories within.
        </p>
        
        <div class="story-body">
            <p>Drive through any part of rural Ireland, and you'll see them – the cottages that have sheltered generations of Irish families. Some are pristine, their thatch neat as a new haircut, their walls brilliant white in the sun. Others lean a bit, weathered by Atlantic storms, their stories written in every stone. The Cottage Collection was born from my love affair with these humble yet beautiful dwellings.</p>

            <p>My own great-grandmother lived in such a cottage near Binevenagh. I remember visiting as a child, ducking through the low doorway painted a brilliant blue – "to keep the spirits out," she'd say with a wink. Inside, the hearth was the heart of everything. She cooked over it, we gathered around it, and on cold nights, its glow was the last thing you'd see before sleep.</p>

            <div class="story-quote">
                "In every Irish cottage, the walls remember laughter, the floors remember dancing, and the hearth remembers every story ever told beside it."
            </div>

            <p>When I began creating the Cottage Collection, I wanted to capture not just the physical beauty of these buildings, but their soul. Each piece features a different cottage, painted with the careful attention to detail that these homes deserve. The yellow cottage with its red door, cheerful as a summer's day. The white cottage with its green door, traditional and welcoming. The blue cottage that reminds me of my great-grandmother's home, with smoke curling from its chimney.</p>

            <p>The glazing process for this collection is particularly special. I use a technique that creates texture in the thatch, making it look almost real enough to touch. The walls have a subtle variation that mimics weathered whitewash. And those doors – I mix the glazes myself to get just the right shade, because in Ireland, your door color is a statement of personality.</p>

            <div class="story-gallery">
                <div class="story-image">
                    <img src="../images/cottage-scene.png" alt="Irish cottage design">
                </div>
                <div class="story-image">
                    <img src="../images/cottage-blue-main.png" alt="Blue cottage design">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>What moves me most about this collection is how it resonates with the Irish diaspora. I've shipped pieces to every corner of the world, often with notes that say something like, "This looks just like my granny's cottage in Mayo," or "This reminds me of the house where my father was born." One woman in New Zealand ordered an entire set because the cottage on the platter looked exactly like her childhood home in Donegal.</p>

            <p>But it's not just nostalgia that draws people to these pieces. There's something deeply comforting about the cottage motif. In our modern world of glass and steel, these images of simple dwellings remind us of a time when life moved more slowly, when neighbors knew each other, when the biggest decision of the day might be whether to have one more cup of tea.</p>

            <p>Each piece in the Cottage Collection is functional art. The plates are perfect for those special Sunday dinners. The mugs hold enough tea for a proper chat. The serving dishes are sized for Irish hospitality – which means they're generous. Because while the cottages themselves might be humble, the welcome within them never is.</p>

            <p>As I paint each cottage, I think about the families who might have lived there. The children who played in the garden. The women who tended the fire. The men who came home from the fields. The stories shared, the songs sung, the lives lived fully within those thick walls. This collection is my tribute to them all – to the cottages that sheltered our ancestors and to the memories they hold still.</p>

        <p class="story-intro">
            Scattered across the Irish countryside, thatched cottages stand as monuments to simpler times, 
            their whitewashed walls and colorful doors holding centuries of stories within.
        </p>
        
        <div class="story-body">
            <p>Drive through any part of rural Ireland, and they appear like old friends – the cottages that have sheltered generations of Irish families. Some are pristine, their thatch neat as a new haircut, their walls brilliant white in the sun. Others lean a bit, weathered by Atlantic storms, their stories written in every stone. The Cottage Collection celebrates these humble yet beautiful dwellings that are as much a part of Ireland as the green fields themselves.</p>

            <p>These cottages, with their low doorways and thick walls, were built to withstand both weather and time. The colorful doors – brilliant blues, cheerful yellows, deep reds, and emerald greens – aren't just decorative choices. In Irish tradition, they serve as both welcome and protection, each color carrying its own meaning and story. Blue to keep the spirits at bay, green to honor the land, red for warmth and passion, yellow for joy and prosperity.</p>

            <div class="story-quote">
                "In every Irish cottage, the walls remember laughter, the floors remember dancing, and the hearth remembers every story ever told beside it."
            </div>

            <p>The Cottage Collection captures not just the physical beauty of these buildings, but their soul. Each piece features a different cottage, painted with careful attention to detail that these homes deserve. The yellow cottage with its red door, cheerful as a summer's day. The white cottage with its green door, traditional and welcoming. The blue cottage that echoes countless homes throughout the countryside, with smoke curling from its chimney like a prayer.</p>

            <p>The glazing process for this collection is particularly special. A unique technique creates texture in the thatch, making it look almost real enough to touch. The walls have subtle variations that mimic weathered whitewash, while the doors feature hand-mixed glazes to achieve just the right shade – because in Ireland, your door color is a statement of personality and a reflection of the soul within.</p>

            <div class="story-gallery">
                <div class="story-image">
                    <img src="../images/cottage-scene.png" alt="Irish cottage design">
                </div>
                <div class="story-image">
                    <img src="../images/cottage-blue-main.png" alt="Blue cottage design">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>This collection resonates deeply with the Irish diaspora. Pieces travel to every corner of the world, often accompanied by notes that speak of recognition and memory: "This looks just like the cottage in Mayo," or "This reminds me of home in Donegal." One customer in New Zealand ordered an entire set because the cottage on the platter mirrored a childhood home perfectly. These pieces become bridges across oceans, connecting hearts to homeland.</p>

            <p>But it's not just nostalgia that draws people to these pieces. There's something deeply comforting about the cottage motif. In our modern world of glass and steel, these images of simple dwellings remind us of a time when life moved more slowly, when neighbors knew each other by name, when the biggest decision of the day might be whether to have one more cup of tea by the fire.</p>

            <p>Each piece in the Cottage Collection is functional art. The plates are perfect for those special Sunday dinners when family gathers. The mugs hold enough tea for a proper chat – because a quick cup is no cup at all. The serving dishes are sized for Irish hospitality, which means they're generous, because while the cottages themselves might be humble, the welcome within them never is.</p>

            <p>Every cottage painted tells the story of the families who might have lived there. The children who played in the garden among the potatoes and cabbages. The women who tended the fire and made soda bread on the griddle. The men who came home from the fields to find warmth and comfort. The stories shared by firelight, the songs sung on winter evenings, the lives lived fully within those thick, protective walls. This collection is a tribute to them all – to the cottages that sheltered our ancestors and to the memories they hold still.</p>

            <p>In the rhythm of the wheel, muscle memory meets meditation. Each piece carries the imprint of a thousand others before it, yet stands utterly unique. In the early morning light at McCluskey Pottery, skilled hands center clay on the wheel, moving without conscious thought, following patterns etched deep through decades of practice.</p>

            <p>There's a moment when learning pottery when everything clicks. It's not gradual – one day you're fighting the clay, and the next, you're dancing with it. Your hands suddenly know the exact pressure needed, the precise speed, the gentle coaxing that transforms a formless mass into something beautiful. It's as if your hands have been waiting all along to remember this ancient skill.</p>

            <p>The pottery tradition runs deep in Irish families. Many potters recall watching their elders work - whether with dough, wool, or wood - with the same intuitive grace now brought to clay. The movements are different, but the knowing is the same – that deep, bodily wisdom that comes from years of practice, of feeling your way into mastery.</p>

            <div class="pull-quote">
                "The clay remembers every touch, every moment of pressure and release. Our hands become the bridge between intention and creation."
            </div>

            <p>During workshops here in Limavady, students often struggle with their minds getting in the way. They think too much, plan too carefully, try to force outcomes. But pottery doesn't respond to force – it responds to presence, to patience, to the quiet confidence that comes when trusting your hands to know what to do.</p>

            <p>Yesterday, a student asked how to know when a piece is finished. There isn't a logical answer. Experienced hands know. They feel the wall thickness, sense the balance, understand the form in a way that bypasses rational thought entirely. This knowing can't be taught – it can only be discovered through hours at the wheel.</p>

            <p>Sometimes when throwing a simple bowl, hands create a curve that echoes pieces made decades ago for special occasions. Or they'll find a rhythm reminiscent of master potters who could throw perfect cylinders with eyes closed. Our hands carry these memories, these echoes of every piece ever made.</p>

            <p>This is why every piece at McCluskey Pottery is still thrown by hand, despite the efficiency of molds and machinery. Each piece needs that direct connection, that conversation between maker and material that happens through touch. When someone holds one of these bowls or mugs, they're holding not just an object, but a moment of connection, a physical memory made manifest.</p>

            <p>The wheel keeps turning, as it has for thousands of years. And with each revolution, our hands remember what our hearts sometimes forget – that we are makers, creators, shapers of the earth itself. In this remembering, we find not just skill, but a kind of prayer, a meditation in motion that connects us to every potter who has ever lived.</p>
